# data-science-project
I worked on an end-to-end data science project using different "Tools and Technologies" like Python, Machine Learning,  Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Data Cleaning Techniques, Geopandas/Folium etc.
I worked on an end-to-end data science project using a global restaurant dataset covering multiple countries and cities, where I handled the entire process from data cleaning and preprocessing to analysis and visualization.The workflow included Data cleaning and Exploratory, Descriptive Analysis, Geospatial Analysis, Predictive Modeling, Customer behavior analysis and Data Visualization. My work focused on transforming raw data into actionable insights through Analysis, Modelling and Data Visualization.
In this project, I applied data science techniques to analyze global restaurant data. In this project, I explored customer preferences, cost trends and cuisine popularity using data science techniques. After cleaning and Preprocessing the data, I performed descriptive and geospatial analysis to identify meaningful patterns across different regions. The project also included predictive modelling to forecast customer-related outcomes, and the results were presented through effective visualizations for better interpretation. I used different types of visuals to explain and present the results.

Tools & Technologies : Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Google Colab, EDA, Scikit-learn, MS Excel, Data Cleaning Techniques, Descriptive Statistics, Geopandas/Folium etc.
